<h1>General Utilities</h1>
Utility scripts for manipulating metadata and performing other tasks related to digital preservation and interaction with the preservica system.

Each script will rely on the preservation_utilities module to get certain tasks done. All other .py files should be invoked on the command line like `python3 someScript.py`. Any interactivity will pop-up from there.

This is not a direct command line utility. Sorry.
